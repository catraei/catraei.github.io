  <h1>Abuse In Competitive Equestrians</h1>
  <h3>The data used was provided from kaggle, specifically data from Olympic winners and from the racing industry.</h3>
  <h4>There has been a lot of reported abuse throughout equestrian history, especially in the racing industry which is
    most talked about. But jocketys don't own or care for the horse unlike the riders do in the Olympics and Grand Prix
    level riding. There is no reason to be cruel to an animal just so they perform better in a competitive place. Do you
    do better when forced to do something? Some of the top horses have been spoiled and trained with ethical riders, but
    there are abusive riders who have made it to the top. Especially when it comes to big horse shows, which are the
    Olympics and Grand Prix. Most of those horses live much shorter and painful lives. It's been a huge problem in the
    equestrian world for years and it's so common that it's hard to stop. Riders believe horses forced into submission
    and who go through abuse, will perform much better. Ethical riders will say horses well cared for perform better
    than a horse in pain. So how exactly do abusive riders compare to the non-abusive</h4>
  <p>Out of 90 riders that didn't place in specifically show jumping in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, 12 of them were
    abusive compared to the 78 non-abusive riders.</p>
  <p>None of the three gold medalists in dressage, show jumping, and eventing had any history of abuse nor have they
    abused their horses for competition.</p>
  <p>Out of the three silver medalists in dressage, show jumping, and eventing only one had abused their horse during
    and before competition. That rider being the dressage participant.</p>
  <p>None of the three bronze medalists in dressage, show jumping, and eventing had any history of abuse nor have they
    abused their horses for competition.</p>

  <h> From what is shown here, from the most recent Olympic winners, the non abusive riders are the ones who placed
    more often than the abusive riders. All of the riders who placed well can be researched on their personal website,
    Wikipedia, and more trusted news sources, including the official Olympic site. It confirms their history with
    horses, their training methods, trainers, past shows, clips of them riding, and them interacting with their horse.
    All of those qualities when being viewed by a person with experience, would show the horses trust in the rider.
    Horses are incredibly sensitive to pain and like any other prey animal they run from it. No horse would react the
    way they do with the medalists if they had no trust within them. Each of the training methods the medalists spoke of
    were common and the healthiest things for a horse to do. One of the gold medalists said how he pulled one of his
    horses from competition because he was concerned for the horses overall wellbeing. Anyone who abuses their animal
    has no care for how they feel. </h>

    <h>I would have to do an excessive amount of research on each rider if I searched
      up each equestrians background on who didn't place, so I chose only show jumping. Only one of the riders turned
      out
      to be abusive and it was the silver placing dressage rider. Dressage is one of the sports with a bad reputation
      because some of those horses are forced to move unethically using harsh bits, spurs, and what's called a "driving
      seat." Using this we can target the equestrian sports which attract the most abuse. We can use that to keep an eye
      on what specific equipment, training methods, etc. that is being used on certain horses. Knowing that information
      it
      can be easier to know what to ban in the Olympics and set new standards in horse competitions. Olympic riders have
      huge influence on what other riders do, so by creating a better, and ethical example of horsemanship, people will
      follow that instead of harmful training. </h>
